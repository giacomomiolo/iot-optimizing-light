### Objectives:
- Minimize people's discomfort due to excessive or poor illumination in the IoT Lab.
- Minimize IoT Lab costs concerning illumination (electricity and investments).
- Plan best schedule based only on weather forecasts

### Options:
- Keep **Neon lights** (not dimmable, costing 0.432€/h) or substitute them with **LED lights** (dimmable, costing max 0.15€/h, cost of investment: 4k€)
- Keep **manual curtains** (schedulable weekly) or substitute them with **motorized curtains**

### Available data:
- Historical data of light sensors and movement sensors in the four Lab areas
- Weather forecasts
